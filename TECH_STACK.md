## Third-Party Integrations

### Resend (Email)
- From: `Bookings @ Indigo Palm Co <bookings@indigopalm.co>`
- Sends: guest confirmation, host new-booking alert, guest payment link
- Docs: resend.com

### Square (Payments)
- Order API with itemized line items
- Line items: accommodation, cleaning fee, taxes, pool heat, 3% CC fee
- Discounts applied as order-level discounts
- Location ID: `LNN3GFNQ81ZQC`
- Dashboard: developer.squareup.com

### PriceLabs (Dynamic Pricing)
- Fetches per-night prices for each property
- Fallback: base price + peak date multipliers hardcoded in worker
- Listings mapped by Hostaway/Airbnb listing ID

### Anthropic / Claude (Guest Message Drafting)
- Worker calls Claude to draft replies to incoming Hostaway guest messages
- Drafts route to auto-send or host-email escalation depending on `messageNeedsEscalation`

### Web Push (PWA Inbox Notifications)
- VAPID-based push; subscribe via `/api/push-subscribe`, key via `/api/vapid-public-key`
- Notifies host of new guest messages needing review at `/inbox`

### QuickBooks (Accounting — OAuth only, no automated sync yet)
- `/qb-callback` currently just displays the OAuth code/realmId for manual token exchange

### Airbnb iCal (Availability)
- Cozy Cactus and Terra Luz use Hostaway as `availabilitySource` (see `booking-config.js`)
- The Sundune and The Well pull availability directly from an iCal URL (`icalUrl` in `booking-config.js`)
- Parsed server-side; blocked dates returned to frontend calendar
- Direct-booking iCal feed also served outbound at `/api/calendar/[slug].ics` for subscribing in Airbnb/Hospitable

### Hostaway (PMS)
- Availability source for Cozy Cactus and Terra Luz
- Webhook (`/api/webhook/hostaway`) receives incoming guest messages, drafts an AI reply via Claude (Anthropic API), and either auto-sends or escalates to email for host review
- Replies/approvals surfaced in the `/inbox` PWA dashboard
- `/api/confirm` creates a Hostaway reservation on direct-booking confirmation to block the calendar (Cozy Cactus + Terra Luz only; The Sundune + The Well use the iCal store instead)

## Booking Flow

```
Guest fills form
  → Selects property, dates, guests
  → Optional: pool heat (Terra Luz only, $75/night, flat $400 for 7+ nights)
  → Optional: promo code
  → Submits

POST /api/booking
  → Validates discount code (does NOT consume yet)
  → Stores booking in BOOKINGS KV with unique id + token
  → Emails host: booking details + "Review & Approve" link
  → Emails guest: "The desert's holding your spot." (no payment link yet)

Host opens admin-approve.html?id=...&token=...
  → Reviews booking
  → Can override total or add flat discount
  → Hits "Send Payment Link"

POST /api/approve
  → Consumes discount code in KV
  → Calculates final total (Zelle amount)
  → Generates Square payment link (total + 3% CC fee as line item)
  → Emails guest: "Your dates are approved." with Square link + Zelle info
  → Marks booking as approved in KV

Guest pays:
  → Via Square (card, 3% fee)
  → Via Zelle to 214-606-1340 (MPT Industries), no fee

POST /api/confirm (called once payment is confirmed)
  → Sends "You're booked" email to guest + confirmation notice to host
  → Blocks the calendar: creates a Hostaway reservation (Cozy Cactus + Terra Luz) or adds to the iCal store (The Sundune + The Well)
```

## Marketing & Social Media

### Pinterest (Active — as of June 2026, Eann-owned)
**Owner:** Eann (transitioned off Sabbir; posting Pinterest herself)
**Sabbir's scope now:** Quora + GEO/AI-search seeding + Goodreads only (no longer Pinterest)
**Sabbir rate:** $9/hr, hours unlimited as of June 3, 2026 (previously capped at 15 hrs/week)
**Contact:** sabbirahmed31dec@gmail.com

**Strategy:**
- Links: use **Airbnb listing links** until 25–30K monthly views, then switch to `indigopalm.co`
- Target pace: 4–5 pins/day (Eann)
- See `sabbir_persona` memory for full Pinterest/GEO/Quora playbook

**Property priority:**
1. Cozy Cactus — families/kids angle, amenities (bunk beds, changing table, hot tub, family kit)
2. Terra Luz — private pool + spa, Latin cultural vibe
3. The Sundune (`ps-retreat`) — photo shoot complete, active
4. The Well — lowest priority (long-term rental, not short-term marketed)

**Seasonal event pins to front-load:**
- BNP Paribas Open (March)
- Coachella + Stagecoach (April)
- Lacrosse tournament (January)

---

### Instagram (Planned)
- One account for all properties (not per-property)
- Strategy: reels > static posts (algorithm favors video)
- Needs Eann on camera for face-to-camera content
- Pinterest > Meta for paid campaigns (less ad saturation in STR niche)
- Not yet started — pending Pinterest foundation
