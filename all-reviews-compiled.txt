📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
The Cozy Cactus is indeed cozy 😀. A spacious house that's tastefully decorated, refreshingly free of the usual cheap or chintzy furnishings found in other Airbnb rentals. It's well stocked with supplies.

Everything is well labeled so easy to find what we need. The hot tub was great with the cool weather.

Eann is a super host, very accommodating and helpful, and extremely responsive.  Average Response Time is given as one hour, but in reality, averaged less than a minute!

If you're planning to attend Coachella, and do things around La Quinta, Palm Desert, etc, this is a super location. We did a lot in Palm Springs and the drive was somewhat too long to be convenient (averaged 50 min to an hour)

Property is within a gated community so felt very safe. It has pools, fitness center and even pickleball courts. Getting in and out of the security gate was easy. We did not have any issues as shared in some reviews.

We had a great stay.

🔒 PRIVATE FEEDBACK:
A few things that can use some improvements:
- the sliding glass doors and screens (from both kitchen and MBR) to the backyard are difficult to open and close. Something wrong with the sliding mechanism. 
- The smoker is great but would be easier and quicker with a gas grill.
- the hot tub is great and clean but water should be drained and tub refilled. It was very foamy from water not being changed out. Monitor indicated age of water!
- the curtain rod in MBR (by sliding glass door) kept falling down when we opened and closed curtains
- would be helpful to have more towel rods in bathrooms for wet towels

Hi Eann. We had a wonderful time. Your rapid responses were welcome. Please take care, and Happy New Year in advance 

On a side note, I saw part of your name, Tuan,  and thought that perhaps you have Vietnamese ancestry. I lived in Asia as a teacher for more than 40 years, and Vietnam 7. years. Anyway, I try to put names with countries.

Thankyou again, Eann.

Eann is a wonderful host, very responsive and kind. The house is also great, exactly like in the photos and description. we loved all the amenities, hot tub, mini golf and just everything. The shared swimming pool and pickleball were great fun for the whole family. We will definitely come back if we are in the area again!

This lovely place had everything we needed. The heated pool was a hit with our family, and the comfortable, clean, and well-stocked apartment made it a great place to stay. The location is also great, being close to shops and a grocery store, and a short drive to downtown Palm Springs. Highly recommended if you’re visiting Palm Springs.

📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
Eann’s home in Indio was perfect for our family of 5! We have young kids and her house was stocked with everything you could need for babies (changing table, high chair, pack n play, etc.) and even had some fun toys and games for our toddlers. The house was very well appointed and had everything we needed from kitchen appliances to coffee to laundry pods. The community was beautiful, had fun pools and was near by to many local attractions. Eann was incredibly responsive and helpful. 10/10 would recommend!

Thanks Eann for the fabulous stay! If we ever come back to Indio we would absolutely seek out your house again. It didn’t feel like a cheap Airbnb flip, it really felt like a home and was perfectly cozy, close to things and full of fun stuff for the kids. Appreciate you helping us with guests/gate lists and being so understanding about the pack n play situation.

📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
I had a wonderful stay here with my cat and would choose this airbnb again. The space was comfortable, homey, and very clean. I appreciated how Eann provided thoughtful instructions on the apartment, its ample amenities, and things to do in the surrounding city.  She was a kind and highly responsive host who made my time here seamless and enjoyable. One example of this was during my stay, when I noticed the keurig wasn't working. She responded quickly and had a new keurig delivered to the house within half a day. Overall, I was so appreciative and happy here and she is an incredible host.

The place is great, as advertised, clean, well-equipped, and while we had one small problem manifest while we were there, Eann handled it efficiently and quickly, even though it was a Saturday night. Great beds and the pool and hot tub are real nice, and close. 

I highly recommend this apartment!

Condo review: We did love our stay at your place, but did find a few things that probably should be brought to your attention. 
1.There were coffee grounds in the paper filter of the coffee pot on arrival.
2.Patio extremely dirty. Heavy dirt in the corners.
3.The washer and dryer were filthy on the outside surfaces. So we cleaned them before use.
4.Hardly any water pressure in small hall bathroom shower and sink.
5.Nepresso  coffee maker didn't work for us at all.
6.Toilet seat loose in the bigger bedroom bathroom.
7.The rugs were looking like they need replacement or better cleaning.
8.Lamp shade on wicker base (in big bedroom) needs repair or something as it does not look straight at all. It tilts to the side.
9.The shower drain was not draining fast as I stood in a good inch of water.(Larger bedroom 
bathroom).
10. Base boards were very dusty. Probably a paint with a smoother finish would decrease dust 
collection and make it easier to clean. Noticed that on the shutters also.

Wonderful & beautifully chic little desert abode! We loved all the family friendly amenities which made our trip so much easier & the kids had a blast, but it was also so cutely styled I could’ve seen myself visiting with a bunch of friends for a girls trip too. Very clean, organized (even drawers labeled), and Eann was so responsive & helpful!

Thanks so much Eann for a wonderful stay! Everything was excellent, and I’m taking so many design inspo notes home with me in mind, ha. The only thing I would’ve suggested is in the master bedroom, the curtains aren’t dark enough to block out the streetlight (or neighbor’s light?) that shines through at night. My husband’s one note was that the master bed has gotten a bit extra soft (I still slept well but I think the master bed has had more wear than the other ones, rightfully so because of the beautiful space). Overall, I’d def recommend your place to anyone! We LOVED all the baby amenities which truly saved us from packing so much, and the foosball, putting green and pool amenities were all amazing. Thanks again!

Hi Eann - you were so awesome. Just a couple reasons we would not rent that unit again would be the pool was sooo cold and it was hard to carry those loungers back and forth too. I love to swim but I could not just get in that pool past my knees. Also, the grounds around the unit were were very dirty. Even cobwebs up the stairs to the unit. Also it really smelled like pee as soon as you turn the corner to go to the unit. I'm not sure why? That being said you were one of the best hosts we've ever dealt with! Thank you so much for everything!

We booked this Airbnb for my friend's wedding and loved it because it had touches of pink which went perfect with her theme. The master bedroom was huge and loved it and the space made it easy for us girls to get ready in. Easy to get there and very clear instructions. The place looked exactly like the pictures and even prettier in person. Thank you so much and would definitely recommend.

Eann's place was absolute perfection. From the carefully labeled switches and drawers to the awesome coffee bar and even more awesome hot tub and mini golf setup, this place had everything. The layout is perfect for families, there was an abundance of towels, the mattresses were super comfortable. It really had everything you could ever want. I joked that I'd have to drag my kids out, but I practically did. We loved the place and can't wait to come back.

I’d say that if there is anything that needs to be fixed for it to be done before arrival. We had an issue with couches and the master bed felt like it sunk in the middle as me and my wife were trying to rest. As well as possibly a tv in the master bedroom.

This is one of the best places our family has stayed in the entire time we’ve been using Air BNB. The house was immaculate and had everything we needed to have a great time.

Loved this stay! Felt like home. It’s a quiet neighborhood which was really nice. We really loved the location too - felt like we were in the middle of anywhere we wanted to go! It has all the amenities you could ever need and they’re good quality too. You can tell Eann really cares about her guests’ stay. It’s super roomy and clean. Loved the showers and the bed was comfy too! Eann was extremely reliable and really quick to respond to any questions I had. We even had to extend our stay 4 days because we loved it so much! We would definitely stay again.😊

The cozy cactus was fantastic. It had many thoughtful touches throughout and was stalked with everything you could imagine. Extremely toddler friendly. Our kids loved the mini golf in the backyard and the pool right next door.
The welcome book was extremely informative and detailed.
Thank you, Eann for a wonderful stay. We will definitely be back!

Really enjoyed Eann’s place. The location was great and the place was comfortable, beautiful, and clean; would definitely stay again. Eann answered all of our questions and was very responsive on messages. The suite had everything we could ever need and was fully stocked - cleaning supplies, great shampoo/conditioner, beach towels, reusable containers for leftovers, and so many spices for cooking. We were so happy with our stay - thanks Eann!

Hi Eann, loved the place! Just wanted to point out a few things that may/may not have been brought to your attention. There were a couple of stains on the couch - should come out easily with an upholstery cleaner, the dishwasher would lean forward when there was weight on the door, and the second bedroom tv remote didn’t have batteries - purchased two AAA (all good, but in case they go missing again it wasn’t us). Thanks for the great memories and really enjoyed your place!

We had a wonderful 2 month stay at Eann's condo, our first visit to Palm Springs. The description in the listing says it all. The condo is extremely well equipped. The kitchen had everything thing we needed and more. The washer and dryer was much appreciated. Being one who grew up in the 60's, really liked the record player. The Sonos speaker was very nice to have. The covered parking kept the car cool in the sun. We and our standard poodle enjoyed the green grass. Eann was always super responsive whenever we needed to contact her. This condo is most likely the nicest one in the complex.

We had an amazing time at this air bnb . By far one of the best properties I have ever stayed at. The pictures are extremely accurate, and everything is as described. Eann is an excellent host who corresponds extremely fast to every query. She was always helpful and responsive. Everything in her home is labeled and easy to figure out, even for seniors like us. The neighbourhood in Indian Palms is very friendly and well maintained. We also had our granddaughter and her parents come down for a week. This house is extremely friendly for a young toddler. The pool is just a few feet away, high chair and various other child items were available. Not a lot of air bnbs supply these items, a big plus for my daughter who got to pack a little less. In addition a lot of people have complaints about how long it takes to get through the gates at Indian Palms… no issue here!! And this is a huge plus ,Eann has a transponder so take it with you and it opens the gates for you.

Eann’s place was the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed at!!!  Well appointed with basic staples in the kitchen! We could cook a meal and have most cupboard ingredients readily available!  (Unheard of in previous rentals).  Eann went above and beyond to make our stay outstanding!  We loved the unit and the beautiful pool was just steps away.  Eann really cares about her guests and it shows.  Outstanding!!!

Eann’s place was exactly as advertised, beautifully renovated and had all the kitchen and home comforts you could need. Very clean and more spacious rooms than they looked online! Eann was great to communicate with, very responsive and her detailed instructions for accessing the unit made entry super easy. The complex itself is clearly older but Eann’s unit is pristine and was perfect for us as we were visiting family nearby. Super close to Trader Joe’s and other necessities. We didn’t actually use the pool area because it was so busy but she had pool towels and noodles and such at the ready. All in all, a good spot for a reasonable price during Modernism week (busy time to go with not a lot available).

A beautiful house in a gated community in Indio. Very peaceful and great HOA amenities. In addition to being super responsive and having a well-stocked house for adults and children of all ages, Eann put in small thoughtful touches like a transponder to open the gates automatically allowing us to enter via any entrance to the HOA, and not have to wait in line at main security. Thanks for a great vacation Eann!

We had the perfect weekend getaway and LOVED Eann’s place. It was absolutely prefect and had everything we needed. She has done a wonderful job with little touches making everything easy and convenient. We got to use the putting green and hot tub and it was great. The 10pm noise curfew was a little annoying but we made it work just fine. It is very close to other neighbors so we were happy to oblige. Thanks a bunch Eann!

Eann’s condo in Palm Springs is lovely.
Perfectly suited for two couples or a family. 
The two bedrooms and two bathrooms are private from the living room/dining area and kitchen.
The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking. Every utensil/appliance is in great shape.
The balcony is very private.
Location is fabulous, 35 minutes from Palm Desert, 45 minutes from Joshua Tree.
More than enough restaurants in PS, but Trader Joe’s is three minutes away. Fabulous food, great prices. Fun to cook in Eann’s kitchen.
Pool and Hot Tub are beautiful. Parking onsite.
I highly recommend staying at Eann’s condo in Palm Springs.

Hi Eanne 

I liked your place but the Internet shuts off and reboots every 10 min which made it very hard to do business on zoom or Google Meet. 

When you walk in the bedroom there’s a noise that creaks and makes a rattling sound which is a little bothersome. 

Other than that it’s great!

The condo had a cozy & welcoming vibe. I prefer a condo to a hotel because I enjoy cooking. Eann's kitchen very well stocked with amazing pots and pans (I'm ordering a set of GreenPans for my kitchen) storage containers, utensils etc. Made cooking a real pleasure. I do recommend a new toaster. Just the right amount of decor. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Everything was extremely clean. The condo was a marvelous place to rest and plan our excursions into Palm Springs and to various hiking trails. Very obvious that Eann is focused on providing a 5 Star Experience for her guests. She reached out more than once to make certain that all was going well and that we were enjoying our stay. I've chosen many AirBnBs. This one is definitely in the top 3. Kudos to Eann for being an amazing host.

I did mention the toaster does need to be replaced. No matter how low the setting, it chars half the bread and leaves the other half totally untoasted. I ended up using two of the gray dish towels for placemats. Your wonderful glass table needs placemats. Also it got a bit chilly in the evenings and so we turned up the heater to 70 degrees. Sort of smelled burning dust and so my husband believes that the furnace filter needs to be changed. 

Really an excellent experience and you've definitely given a lot of thought to making it as comfortable and pleasant as possible for your guests.

Take Good Care and Happy Holidays.

Beyond happy with Eann’s place! She was a super responsive host and had every amenity you could think of! It was extremely family friendly with all of the things you could need for a baby and kids! The layout was very functional. The space was clean. The kitchen was well stocked. It was close to lots of restaurants and shops. We would 100% stay here again!

📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
First and foremost, I highly recommend you book this property with Eann because the home is cozy, fun, and Eann was an excellent host! Eann was very helpful, friendly, and she communicated clear instructions and feedback. I appreciated how responsive and flexible she was. For example, I requested an early check in because we were traveling with a baby and a toddler and attempting to avoid traffic and the heat. Eann was flexible in letting us check in early for no additional charge. 

In addition, my family had so much fun putting in the backyard. My toddler was obsessed with "golf" and we putted for hours over the course of our stay.  I really appreciated the attention to detail Eann had with the coffee bar, cookbooks, and local dining recommendations such as Heirloom Craft Kitchen. We ended up ordering a to go from Heirloom Craft Kitchen and it was absolutely delicious. 

Overall, this is a family friendly property and I highly recommend this property to everyone!

Hi Eann, I have minimal suggestions because we were very pleased with everything! The only suggestion I think that would add value is to replace the sheets with cooler perhaps better quality cotton sheets. I found them to be fairly hot and not breathable at night at least in the primary room where I slept. It did keep me up a bit, but I understand that others may have different preferences. Nonetheless,  I suspect that given the heat and desert climate a cooler fabric would improve the comfort for most people.

We loved our time at Eann’s home! It was so cute, clean, spotless - she thought of everything!

The location was perfect - we were looking quiet and relaxing, but still in Palm Springs. The Palm Springs surf club is 5 minutes away and we had a great time. We also spent a lot of time at the community pool right around the corner, and we were the only ones there that it felt like a private pool. 

The bedrooms were huge (especially the primary), the bathrooms were so cute and clean, and overall you can tell Eann put a lot of thought into the design and furnishings. We had an amazing time and can’t wait to come back!

It is beautiful, very well-appointed, incredibly clean, spacious, and comfortable. The beds were very comfortable. We loved the kitchen! Eann has thought of every detail. We loved having a garage w/ a remote opener. Her home is very family friendly and comfortable. The air conditioning is GREAT, which was a necessity with 113 degree temps. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. We couldn't have asked for more! Thanks, Eann!

Thanks, Eann! Everything was perfect! We loved staying at your home and appreciated all of your attention to detail. The only recommendation we would offer is considering black-out curtains in the bedrooms. I don't know if you have other guests keeping crazy hours like we do, but it was a bit difficult to sleep in with the bright, sunny days in Indio. Not bad, and we're not complaining. It's just a thought. I've stayed in many Air BNB's and your is one of the very best! I LOVED the comfy master bed with the huge pillows. :) Thank you so much. We hope to return. :)

Eann, thank you so much for hosting us. We had such a fun girls weekend thanks to your accommodations. Hopefully our review will brighten your day!

There were just a couple things I wanted to bring to your attention:

There is an electrical outlet in the queen bedroom next to the door that has a broken outlet face. We didn’t have any issues with it but it might be a safety hazard.

The dishwasher leaks a little bit of water from the bottom right corner when running. Again, it wasn’t a major issue - we just set a rag there when we ran it - but just wanted you to be aware.

Thank you again and if we ever find ourselves needing a place to stay in Indio again, we’ll be sure to look you up!

The only thing I would change would be the coffee creamers since I think they were expired; once I poured them into the coffee it was chunky.

Eann is truly the most incredible host! Every detail of the house was so thoughtfully done. We couldn’t imagine a better location to enjoy Coachella. The house is within walking distance of the festival - in a safe and quiet neighborhood. Eann provided us with so many helpful instructions in a cute little ‘Festival Guide’ which made our experience seamless. The house is beautiful, spotlessly clean, spacious and comfortable. It is also filled with SO many amenities. Eann is friendly, communicative, and responded to any questions we had immediately. You won’t regret booking this spot! An absolute Coachella dream!!

Hi Eann!

Thank you so much again for a wonderful stay! It’s so apparent how much care and passion you put into The Cozy Cactus. It is definitely the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in. 

I appreciate how responsive you were regarding the construction workers. 

We were trying so hard to be respectful to the house rules: I made my husband and Hitomi sit in the car for 10 minutes until it was exactly 4:00pm. When Molly + Scott got in at midnight, we whispered as we helped them with their bags and I forbade them from going on the porch. We felt we were truly Coachella ‘dream guests’.

When  I got your message Friday (after driving 3 hours and not really thinking straight) I didn’t expect the solar panel would be a big deal. So I felt a bit let down - paying almost $10k - to have such a disruption. That level of noise for hours is unacceptable at any price, but especially paying that premium.. 

I understand these things happen and I would still definitely recommend and book again. ❤️

Située dans un joli environment calme, c’est la premières fois que nous nous sommes véritablement reposés pendant nos vacances avec nos 3 enfants !

Eann the only thing I can say is your place could have been a bit cleaner.  The Kitchen runner was very dirty but once we washed it we felt better.  Once we washed the floors with the swiffer and did some dusting we felt more at home.  Also the couch is really warped in the middle and not very comfortable.  Your TV was amazing once Jim could figure it out.  I don't know maybe just a Canadian thing? lol. We were not used to streaming TV  so it took a while to figure out all you can do with it.  Over all we really enjoyed our stay and found you to be delightful.  Thanks again for hosting us.  Maybe, if we can, we we'll be back next year.

We had a great stay at Eann's place. The place was spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. We travelled with our 1.5 year old and really appreciated all the amenities (pack and play, high chair, change pad, kids books & toys) to help make our stay with our toddler feel relaxing. Loved the hot tub, having coffee every morning in the backyard, and the very comfortable main (green) bed. Appreciated all the little extras at this location including travel coffee cups, Tupperware storage for food, nice beach towels for the hot tub/pool, etc. 

We received weather flood alerts during our stay and Eann was very responsive in giving us advice on how to navigate all of this. Overall, a wonderful stay - we'd highly recommend this location. Felt very safe, cozy, and the community pool was warm and nice to use even during the cool weather!

Thanks Eann! We had a great time staying at your place! 

A couple of minor things to let you know about:
- the smoke detector went off the one time we went to use your oven. I'm not sure if it just does that sometimes or if maybe the oven needed cleaning. Just a heads up!
- there is a transition board on the floor between the flooring in the main bedroom (where the green bed is) and the bathroom ensuite, and that board is loose/fell off. It likely just needs to be glued back down. Not sure if anyone told you about that yet!

With so many options in the desert, I'm so glad I chose this place for decor, location, accommodations, the community pool, and amenities. Seriously, Eann has thought of everything! She was the most responsive, pleasant host I've ever had at an Airbnb. I ran out of time before getting to explore all of Palm Springs. There were beautiful views and it was easy enough access to downtown,  

Eann is such a friendly and proactive host - she thinks of everything. Next time I am in Palm Springs for work, I will be sure to stay longer, especially with her unique and clever wall desk setup, great wifi, and well stocked kitchen.

Countless thoughtful touches make Eann's condo an excellent choice for digital nomads, couples, or anyone wanting a peaceful desert getaway. 10/10 recommend. Thanks so much for a great stay, can't wait to come back!

Honestly this one probably the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! And I’ve been staying at Airbnb’s for 10 years. This is the first time seeing the place in person was better than the pictures.
The place was very clean, spacious and comfortable. Everything was easy to find and every room from the bathroom, to the kitchen and even the laundry room were well stocked. I have zero complaints and would definitely come back!

Thanks again for having us! Just wanted to let you know one of the door cabinets under the island was loose. We found it that way so not sure if it was brought to your attention yet but I wanted to make you aware.

Also the single bed in the room with the bunk beds was kinda squeaky. Every time I moved the bed frame made a squeaking noise. 

Other than that everything was amazing! We really enjoyed our stay and my mom especially appreciated how everything was labeled. She wanted me to let you know she loved that! haha

This place was perfect for our week stay. Plenty of room for 3 adults and a child. The backyard was fun and quiet, perfect for a morning cup of coffee. 

We found everything we could possibly need and more. It was easy to get to Palm Springs for work and into Joshua Tree for some sight seeing. Don’t hesitate to book this home.

The Cozy Cactus is in a peaceful gated community and was the perfect spot for our family to recharge after spending the day in Joshua Tree. The house was well-stocked with necessities, and had clear instructions on how to access & use all the amenities. We particularly loved being so close to the community pool, and the kids enjoyed the backyard putting green.

Absolutely loved my stay at Eann’s condo in Palm Springs! The location was unbeatable, with stunning views and easy access to local attractions. The amenities provided were top-notch, from the well-equipped kitchen (Keurig, French press, coffee pot) to the relaxing pool area (just on the other side of the building - heated too!). What truly made the experience exceptional was the host, who went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and enjoyment throughout my stay. A perfect getaway – I can't wait to return!

Eann is an exceptional host very responsive and friendly, she checked on us during the storm and made us feel very comfortable. We felt like we were home the entire time. This was our first time in Palm Springs but will definitely return to  Eanns Cozy Cactus.

📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
Eann’s condo's is AMAZING! One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed at. It’s dream for anyone looking to explore downtown Palm Springs - close enough to all the action, while having a clean, comfortable place to return to at the end of the day. Eann goes above and beyond by offering a starter set of essentials, ensuring that you have everything you need right from the start.
I was blown away by the beautiful design and thoughtful touches that made this place feel like a true home away from home (record player, murals, renovated bathroom with gold accents and Further brand shampoo, conditioner, and soap, books, Roomba, etc). The brand new washer/dryer was an unexpected bonus, especially since most other rentals don’t have one, plus great AC in the desert heat, woof.
The attention to the detail, the luxurious amenities and convenient location make this condo a sure steal. If you visit Palm Springs, definitely consider to choose this condo as your stay. Thank you again, Eann!

We came across Eann’s place as we were searching for a kid-friendly and clean place on Airbnb and decided to book with her. Eann is a very nice, friendly and responsive host. The check-in is fairly easy and her welcome guide book is clear and very detailed. Upon check in, we noticed that one of the carbon monoxide alarm was left opened with no battery inside and the lights over dining room were out. We contacted her and she had them fixed the next day. However, the floor on the day we checked in feels a bit sticky. There was also a dirty cleaning rack left at the property. We were only in town for 2 nights and just wished that the experience would have been better.

I loved staying at Eann’s place and understand first hand why she has a 5 Star Super host rating. From the moment I booked my stay until I checked out, Eann was always proactive, friendly, and responsive. Her home was set up in such a way that it made me feel like I was in my own personal vacation home and as a parent I really appreciated the thoughtful touches that made it easy to keep my one year old entertained (such as games, play pen, Disney +, high chair, etc). 

What stood out to me the most (aside from the decor), was how clean the home was, and how clearly everything was labeled (I’ve stayed in other homes where things were cluttered and hard to find). 

I will definitely return to stay at the “Cozy Cactus” again!

We had a great stay at the Cozy Cactus!
The house is very comfortable, very well decorated, well lit, just like the pictures! We felt right at home! 
We loved the pool just across the street!
The back patio was very cute, fun place to hang out (even though it was starting to get very hot in Indio during our stay at the beginning of July).
The gated community is very nice, lots of walking trails alongside the golf course. We also used the lifestyle center to go play pickle ball one morning and had a great time with some of the permanent residents there. 
Eann is a very responsive host. We would definitely rent from her again! Overall a great vacation!

The cozy cactus was indeed very cozy, we felt right at home! Everything is decorated so cute, no clutter, it just felt so nice!
We appreciated your responsiveness.
Just a few suggestions:
For a whole week we would have loved a couple more dish towels (we just had one) and a couple rags (to wipe counters (there was a sponge for dishes). A griddle would be a great addition to the kitchen.
And as I already mentioned to you, maybe not having ground crew on the back patio at 6:45 am:)
We really enjoyed our stay and were happy to give you a great review!

We have been staying at Airbnb for almost 10 years and this is the first place that the host labeled everything, from switches on the wall to all drawers to scything single remote control. It’s soooo helpful.  This is inside a gated community with security guard at the entrance 24/7 to verify every visitor has a reason to go inside. We feel really safe. 
The place is super clean and plenty of space for 6 of us to stay comfortably. The kitchen is well equipped and the coffee maker is very nice touch: you can start your day by grinding some coffee beans to make your own coffee. We also enjoyed the jacuzzi  very much. After a long day, soaking in jacuzzi feels really great. The host Eann is very responsive and proactive. We will definitely try to rebook this place in the future if we visit this area again.

The place was immaculate. We have an electric car so was ableto charge our car. The kitchen, the utensil and all the electrical hardware was spotless. The coffee machine, percolator, toaster, the bbq etc were all great. Instructions in the house was also very clear. Anything that you wished for was provided like coffees, organic tea, many many herbs, olive oil you name was there. The TV in every room had all the channels like Netflix, Apple TV and many more working. The foosball table was also great to have. I personally even glued the
already lifting (it was like that when we got there) side border. 
In short the hosts were amazing with the way the house was prepared. We all want to thank her from here and they should go on train other house owners. We are frequent users of Airbnb and have never had house so well prepared.

Eann was a wonderful host and we enjoyed our time here very much. We loved it so much that, after our initial 3 days, we decided to extend our trip! Eann was very responsive and made adding in extra time so easy! 

The house is as pictured and the decor is lovely. Eann has so much information on hand and made check in, pool access, and any other questions we had super easy.

What made the stay really next level though we're all the added amenities. From the coffee bar to board games to pool floaties and towels, she had everything we could need to enjoy our stay. We also picked this place because we were traveling with a baby and toddler and they had everything we needed! Crib, high chair, changing table, extra toiletries. They had it all. I would recommend this place again and again and we will probably try to come back at the same time next year!

Thank you so much for sharing your guest home with us. It was so lovely. We also very much appreciate your responsiveness when we had questions and for letting us stay an extra hour. The kids got a little extra time in the pool and we didn’t have to wait at the airport for an extended period of time. 

I did wand to mentioned that we had a hard tome using the grill. We couldn’t get it to stay up to temp when opening and closing to flip food and we had to look up Insteon refilling with pellets. It is quite possible that this was a user error on our part but may be good to have some instructions on there. 

Other than that, all was well and we hope to rerun again someday.

📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
Enjoyed our 1st time in Palm Springs and Eann's home made it even better. We all (family of 4) had our own space to sleep & relax and we were able to to enjoy the comfort of the hot tub after our long days of hiking or shopping. We loved our morning walks around the community and we found it easy to come and go through the security gate. Eann's home was sparkling clean and we loved the style.

Thanks for being responsive & quick to answer questions. Sorry that I didn't realize the link  for the welcome book& the book in the house were different until a few days into our trip. I appreciated your help when finding a another pool to go too since the closest one was under construction. I hope we were able to help the cleaning crew out a little after you gave us an extra hour for check out. We all loved the home and I think my husband said 3 different times, "This is the nicest place we have ever stayed." Our kids (13 & 16) loved ending our day in the hot tub and are now convinced we need one! Thanks for giving us a fun & comfortable spring break family vacation! -Tiffany

We had an excellent stay! Eann was the best Airbnb host we’ve ever encountered- everything about the stay was curated to go above and beyond all guest needs and she was extremely responsive and helpful! We were traveling with a 3 month old and all the baby items were AMAZING and thoughtful- such a family friendly home. 11/10 would recommend this home and will be back again!

📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
Eann's place is by far the most beautiful, well stocked, comfortable and cleanest Air B&B we've every stayed in.  Our family of five (kids ages 13,, 10, 4) enjoyed the our time there and it was even warm enough to use the pool right next door on one of the days we visited.  The neighborhood is quiet and everyone was very friendly.  We felt comfortable and safe leaving our kids so we could do walks and runs around the neighborhood.  The hot tub was immaculate as was everything really and the beds were very plush and comfy!  We'd highly recommend and will definitely book the Cozy Cactus again in the future!

🔒 PRIVATE FEEDBACK:
On the night we arrived, the line to enter the neighborhood was massive so we went to dinner and came back - so not a big deal at all.  We learned that there was a tennis thing happening in the area so that might have attributed to the extra traffic?  A heads-up would have been nice but totally understand that this isn't always possible as you can't possibly know everything going on :).

📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
My family had an excellent stay at Eann’s house. There was more than enough space for me and my wife, two boys and a grandpa. The house has a private back yard in a quiet neighborhood, and inside is clean and welcoming, with a huge kitchen and a bunch of ways to make coffee! Eann provides amenities for young kids, plus games and a foosball table, pool toys and even pickle ball racquets that we tried out. The boys also loved the bunk beds!

We spent a ten day vacation driving around the area to restaurants, hiking in Murray Canyon and Joshua Tree Park, and visiting the zoo in Palm Desert. But we spent plenty of time relaxing in the house hot tub and swimming with our boys in the nearby pools.

Eann was incredibly responsive, answering questions and making sure we had what we needed. This is a great place to unplug with your family, make some memories and relax.

The “cozy cactus” was a great place for us to have as a home base to spend a few days in Palm Springs (Indio) … Eann has put so much care into looking after “anything” you could wish for in an Airbnb … fabulously well stocked, and beautifully decorated. Private little covered patio is so nice to spend a morning in the early sun with a gourmet coffee from her new little coffee & tea bar - such a nice welcoming touch. Very comfortable & quiet place for our family, when in Palm Springs - Great host ! - Thanks for sharing your little oasis with us - would “highly”recommend!!

Everything about this AirBnB was amazing.  The styling of the house was spot on, truly beyond beautiful.  The kitchen had everything you needed, the house was spotless and the area was quiet.  We had very comfortable beds to sleep on and the host even provided pool towels!  I think my favorite part was simply how communicative Eann (the host) was.  She checked in on us and helped us every step of the way.  We could not have asked for a more perfect experience!  Definitely going to be coming back again if we are in the area!

📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
The house was very clean and had everything we needed. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils and spices. They had a Treager grill that was super easy to use. The hot tub was clean and easy to use. Lots of blankets and pillows kept it cozy. The community outdoor pool and spa is two houses away-very close. You can walk to the Polo Grounds through the back entrance-about 30 minute walk (1.5 miles). Getting into the gated community can get backed up at busy times, so allow for that. Technically you can’t get out of the back/resident entrance but you can slip out behind another car when they leave…
Overall, the hosts were very responsive and great! Thanks!

First of all, WOW. 
Second of all, I will never give another place a 5 star review unless it lives up to the experience I had at Eann's Cozy Cactus. 

I was in town for a work conference and my sisters and mom met me there for a short girls' trip. Eann was very flexible with booking the reservation as I had to change the dates slightly and then also needed early check in as we were headed out to hike in Joshua Tree.

The photos in the listing are marvelous but the house is EVEN BETTER than the photos. There is not one detail that was not thought of. Eann even has recommendations for food or drinks in the area. We went to five out of ten of them, none of them disappointed. One of the taco shops was rated the top taco shop of Coachella this year as well. 

Overall just the best experience any of us have had staying at an Airbnb and it made the week just that much better. If there is ever a reason for me to be staying near Palm Springs again, I would not consider staying anywhere else.

Eann, THANK YOU. This was seriously the best stay I have had with any Airbnb. I hope I have a reason to come back to Palm Springs area again to stay here. We really appreciate how responsive you were with communication, the flexibility with needing to change the dates a little and adding the early check in. Your PDF of instructions was so helpful and made check in and out so smooth and easy. Every drink or food recommendation was great. And it's a very small detail, but not having a fee for turning on the hot tub was a huge deal. All of the other places we looked at had such outrageous fees to have the hot tub turned on and we just wanted to be able to hang out at the end of the day.

So many thoughtful touches that really make it delightful. The neighborhood is decent and quiet. The pool is nothing special, but decent and super close. All communication was super timely and thorough. Only sad that we’ll probably never be able to stay at this price again because it’s sure to become too popular!!

Eann’s house is beautiful. She really thought of everything, from a Wifi QR code, to a pack n play, sound machine, plenty of towels, entertainment, and even better, it was one of the cleanest places I’ve stayed at. It’s perfect for families - she even has outlet protectors and baby wipes for us to use.

We were curious about the community pool, since it wasn’t private, but honestly it’s so close - you can literally see it outside of the front door. She even provided pool floaties and noodles to use as well.

She was super responsive to my messages and extremely accommodating. Can’t wait to come back and try out all of the amenities. If you’re hesitating to book this place, you won’t regret it.

We absolutely loved staying here! Such a well decorated and comfortable place. The space was perfect for my family and they were so thoughtful. They saw that we were traveling with an infant and put out the pack n’play along with a sound machine. Next time we go this will be my first choice!

This is the cutest and perfect house for a nice getaway from it all! The house was immaculate, and so cozy. We planned a last min trip and Brandon was super helpful and prompt in responding to our messages. The spa was so nice and relaxing. We can’t wait to come back  for a longer  stay to enjoy the other amenities like the bbq/smoker, the patio area and pool.

We really appreciated his responsiveness in communication we had  a small snag with the front door but we came to a quick solution. I really can’t say enough about how well stocked the house was, we didn’t stay long enough to use the smoker or enjoy the patio so we will be back.

Place was great! We truly enjoyed the space for the night. 
Only a couple of things: 
1. blankets in the master closet smelled like dogs and had dog hair on a few of them. 
2. Recommend a Bluetooth speaker. ⭐️

I won’t put that in my public review bc I thought the place was great. Wish we could have stayed a couple extra days.

📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
This place is SO clean, has extremely comfortable beds, and lots of fresh towels. This was a last minute booking and the hosts were quick to respond. The place looks even better in person with great design. The furniture is super high quality and the couch is SO NICE. Their coffee setup is also very generous, with a French Press, a Keurig, and a drip coffee pot depending on what kind of coffee you like. Usually you only see a keurig.

If you're looking for a sign to book this property, this is it. I only wish I had more time to stay and enjoy the space.

AMAZING place and so beautiful! Everything was extremely well thought out, from the Wi-Fi QR code to the cacti design elements throughout. I stayed in the third bedroom, and they even had light switches under the sconces on the wall with USB ports to plug my chargers in directly. So convenient and so thoughtful. 

I’m so glad I took a chance on this Airbnb, and can’t wait to come back and bring my family or girlfriends for a girls trip. Also the location is beautiful, with the desert view and the palm trees. It’s located in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood. Thank you Brandon and Eann!

📝 PUBLIC REVIEW:
Eann and Brandon were wonderful hosts! They both were extremely communicative and accommodating before and during our stay in The Cozy Cactus. This place is so cute and everything was thought of when it came to the amenities. They even have a QR code that connects you automatically to their wifi! The AC worked wonderfully in the middle of the desert heat and check in with the smart lock was so easy. We also felt super safe in the gated community. We enjoyed escaping in the beautiful community pool, which is literally a 1 minute walk away. Even better though, the private jacuzzi on the patio was so relaxing at night. Such a great place to stay. The place is perfect for a short weekend trip or a long stay. Highly recommend!

“Eann and Brandon’s place was exactly as described. So cozy! I was stunned by the design, cleanliness, and the comfort of the beds. You can tell everything was super intentional, including the USB wall chargers, extension cords everywhere, well stocked Keurig coffee station and kitchen, the beautiful outdoor jacuzzi with a view, and the colorful game room. Plus Brandon and Eann were extremely responsive and accommodating hosts.

I will be sure to stay at The Cozy Cactus next time I’m in town. Plus the location can’t be beat for any future Coachella festivals. We can’t wait to come back. Thank you so much!”
